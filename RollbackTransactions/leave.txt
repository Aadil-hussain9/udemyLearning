Hello Daman,
I am writing this request regarding work from home (WFH) for 3 weeks during the holy month of Ramadan. 
I will be observing the fast during this time and 
would greatly appreciate the flexibility to work from home, which will 
allow me to better manage my schedule and balance my personal and work responsibilities.
I tried here but I am not geting proper food and care due to which it affects my health.
I believe that working from home will not only allow me to maintain my 
productivity levels but also help me stay focused and be more efficient 
in completing my work.
I would like to request for WFH from 10 april 2023 to 
30 april 2023, which will allow me to complete the month of Ramadan 
and celebrate the Eid festival with my loved ones. 

I will be available during regular working hours and will ensure that all my 
responsibilities are met on time.
I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter, and I hope 
that my request can be granted. 

Thank you for your consideration.
